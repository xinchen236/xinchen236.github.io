Hi~ I am a Ph.D. candidate in School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) at Harvard University, working with [Prof. Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/). 
I received my double B.S. degrees in engineering physics and economics from Tsinghua University in 2015, and the master degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University in 2017 under the supervision of [Prof. Wenchuan Wu](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/index.php?s=/cms/144.html). 

My research interests lie in learning, optimization, and control of cyber-physical systems, with emphasis applications to power and energy systems. In particular, I am broadly interested in robust optimization, distributed optimization and control, reinforcement learning, etc.
