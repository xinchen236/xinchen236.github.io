1- How to add a new section page in the level of "Publications" and "Research"?

Procedure: 1) Make sure that there is such a "scope" in the "_config.yml" file. For example, the "publications".
2) Modify the file "_data/navigation.yml" to add a section page in the main page, where "url" is a link to the corresponding file in "_pages/".
3) Add a file either ".md" or "html" in "_pages/" to present the main contents.
4) It may also link to some sub files in the main page, such as "_research" folder, so remember to change the modulars in such folders.
